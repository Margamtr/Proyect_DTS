## Project Overview

To improve its sales and marketing strategies, the company has gathered a significant amount of data on its products, customers, and sales transactions. This data is fundamental for analyzing customer behavior, identifying sales trends, and optimizing inventory.

The client has asked us to create a dashboard that compiles the most relevant information from the collected data and answers the following questions:

### Customer Behavior

- Understand the age of the customers
- Identify which customers buy the most and most frequently

### Trend Identification

- Understand how buying habits have changed over time
- Identify if certain categories are being purchased now that were not before, or vice versa
- Determine which days of the week accumulate the most sales

### Inventory Optimization

- Understand which categories are the most popular
- Identify products that are no longer selling

## Additional Tasks

As a bonus, we have been asked to create a database to store the cleaned data tables so that all departments can access this data.
